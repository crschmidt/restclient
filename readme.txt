restclient started as a quick hack at a one-day hack 
event hosted at Betahouse in Cambridge in 2007.

That was the peak of its career :)

It's a simple wxPython script for doing various HTTP
actions ("REST" requests). GET, POST, PUT, DELETE;
some support for basic HTTP auth. 

To run on mac, download and install the appropriate
wxPython libraries from 
http://www.wxpython.org/download.php and then run:

VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT=yes pythonw restclient.py
